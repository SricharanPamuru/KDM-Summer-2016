But boring as it was, this first-round snooze had one unexpected consequence: It has set up what could become the most enthralling, suspense-filled, high-octane knockout rounds in international soccer’s recent history.

One side of the Euro 2016 bracket features a murderer’s row of colossal powers. All five of Europe’s World Cup winners—England, France, Spain, Germany and Italy—will fight it out for a place in the final. None of the teams on the other side has won a major tournament, raising the prospect that a longtime nobody or upstart nation could wind up hoisting the trophy in Paris on July 10.

“I’m looking forward to it, because now these are the exciting games,” Germany manager Joachim Löw said. “Sooner or later, the opposition has to risk something, because you can’t always play 0-0 in the knockouts.”

Even the organizers appear to recognize that Saturday’s round of 16 marks the start of a new tournament—UEFA has introduced a new match ball for the knockout rounds.

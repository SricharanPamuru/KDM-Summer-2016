Cena started his pro wrestling career in 1999 with Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), and won the UPW Heavyweight Championship the following year.[9] Cena signed a developmental contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later renamed to WWE) in 2001, debuting on the WWE main roster in 2002. From a generic character in 2002, Cena morphed into an arrogant and edgy rapper for the time period of 2002-2003.[10][11] Cena later transitioned to his current character, which he describes as a "goody-two shoes Superman".[12] However, Cena has been labeled as the "most polarizing pro wrestler ever" as his character has many supporters and many detractors.[13] In 2015, WWE credited Cena as being the "face of WWE" from 2004,[14] while in 2012, IGN described Cena as WWE's franchise player since 2005.[15]
